# Obstacle Detection System for multirotor aerial aircraft - Engineer's Thesis

## Description
The point of this project is to create a system integrated with physical aerial aircraft, which is capable of precise distance measuring around aircraft. The application of this system might be beneficial in indoor autonomous flights.

This repository contests source code for three embedded modules designed for the project:
* ODSmain - the module that ensure comminution between aerial aircraft systems and sensors modules
* ODSsensor - the module that collects data from miniature distance sensors VL53L0
* ODSlidar - the module that collects data from long-range distance sensor LIDAR-Lite V3
